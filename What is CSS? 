CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets:
Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents

CSS and HTML work hand in hand:
HTML sorts out the page structure.
CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed.
To understand CSS, you should already have a basic understanding of HTML.

HTML: Skeleton
CSS: Skin
JavaScript: Muscles

HTML = Content + Structure
CSS = Presentation + Appearance
JS(Java Script) = Behaviour + Interactivity

webpage = human
HTML = Skeleton
CSS = Skin
JavaScript = Muscles

HTML is the skeleton and CSS is skin of The webpage,
like a human body that gives attractive look to the website.

Why use CSS?

CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.
The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to seperate style from
content. Using just HTML, all styles anf formating are done in the smae
p;ace.
