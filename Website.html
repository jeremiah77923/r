<p class="quote">"Declare variables, not war"</p>
<p>This is a website to view my programming experience and learn more about what makes
me a good programmer. I believe in the power of programming and computer science to change the world and people's lives for the 
better. I belive I have the porgramming capbilites to complete complex tasks and change the world.</p>
<hr/>
<h2> Here are the programming langauges I know:</h2>
<p><ins>1.Java</ins></p>
<p><ins>2.Python</ins></p>
<p><ins>3.HTML</ins></p>
<hr/>
<p>I am constanly coding and showing my projects on SoloLearn and Github. Sololearn is a website that has courses over many
different coding langauges,data structures, and mmany other things related to computer science. It has coding challenges and many other
ways to pratice coding and imporve your skills. It really spurred my interest in programming. GitHub is a way to share projects and
connect with many different people to imporve your porgramming capabilites, because in order to be a good progarmmer you must grow, develop, and connect
woth your fellow peers.</p>
<h3>Here is a link to my Github and Sololearn profiles</h3>

<!--  The browser does not disply comments but they help documnet the HTML and add decsriptions, reminders, and notes.  -->
<!--  HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. -->
<!--  An HTML element is written using a start tag and an end tag, and with the content in between them-->
<!--  HTML "/Users/jeremiahhawthorne/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/derivatives/C/CE0066AF-83A7-4DF1-8504-336F808E9654_1_105_c.jpeg"documents consist of nested HTML elemets -->
<!--  somet HTML elements like the br tag do not have end tags -->
<!--  General HTML consists of opening and closing tags, and the content -->
<!--  < br /> gives a line break
         <hr/> is how you do a horizontal line-->
<!-- Attributes: -->
<!-- Attributes provide additional information about an element or a tag, while also modifying them. Most attributes
have a value, the value modifies the attribute -->
<!--  TO allign something to the center use the allign attribute in the opening tag and set it equal to "center" -->
<!--  The <img> tag is used to insert an image. It only coontains attributes, and it does not have a closing tag.
   The image's URL(adress) can be defined using the src attribute
   The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image-->
   <!-- To define the image size, use the width and height attributes. The value can be specified in pixels or as a percent -->
   <!-- Loading images takes time. Using large images can slow down your page so be careful. -->
   <!-- By defulat an image has no borders. Use the border attribuet withitn the ihe image tag to create a border around an image. <img src ="tree.jpg" height ="150px" width - "150px"
   border"1px" alt = " " /> If you increase the pixel size the size of the border will also increase. -->
  <!--  Links in HTML:
    Links are an integral part of every web page. You can add links text or images that will enable th euser to
    click on them in order to be directed to another file or webpage.
    IN HTML links are defined using <a> tag. Use the href attribute to define
    the link's destination address:
    <a href=""></a>
    <a href""></a>
    <a href="image address"></a>
    To link an image to another document, simply nest the <img> tag inside <a> tags.   -->
